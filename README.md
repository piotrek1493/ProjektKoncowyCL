# ProjektKoncowyCL

This is a graduation project prepared as a final step of Java Developer: Web bootcamp at CodersLab. The back-end was written in Java using Spring(MVC, Data) & Hibernate frameworks
as well as MySQL relational database. The front-end of this website was created in:

        -HTML/Bootstrap;
        -CSS;
        -JSP/JSTL;
        -Javascript/JQuery;

        It's a small platform created for those who wish to put their real estate for a rent

        Users (upon registration) can:

        -Browse other users' offers;
        -Add new offers;
        -Comment on other users' offers;
        -Message other users;
	-Edit/delete his/her account;

In order to run this application you need to:

-Import this to IntelliJ as a Maven Project
-Edit the persistence.xml file in resources/META-INF/ directory accordingly, so that it matches your database parameters
-For now you also need to change the path for photo uploads in controllers

The application does not need any other SQL script or pre-defined data to work properly.

TODO list:

-Improvement of front-end/views
-Improvement of validation mechanisms
-Redisigning photo uploading, so that the photos/images can be uploaded from anywhere on the machine
